Hi I am trying to add this new file and see if I can get the file to the other repo.

Conflicting with the current file lets see how git handles this!! 
The above line was conflicting with another line that was added from another clone of the same repo. 
Git didnt throw an error when doing the commit. But the push did create a conflict. This was then logged into the log. 
And in CVS style it showed the changes between the local HEAD and the line in the commit. 

Adding this new line and watching it get pulled from the master in the other directory

Finally the below log was printed when I pulled in the changes in the other repo
