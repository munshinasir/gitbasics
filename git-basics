Welcome to the Git Basics Notes

Today we are learning about git. Our current best place for version control. Git is a distributed VCS (Version Control System). It doesnt work like our usual central version control systems where the central server holds all the files and we checkout the files from there and commit to the central repository. 

Git works where the entire repository is replicated on the client side. Then the user makes the changes to the files as he requires. Once satisfied with the changes he can add them to the staging area and that would be used to commit the files - only those selected are committed. 

These committed set of files are then replicated to the central and other repositories - when someone does a pull. 

Advantage of this is that 
1. Losing the central repository isnt that big a deal cause each checkout is a complete repository
2. The entire repo is compressed such that it doesnt create a space overhead on the client side.
3. Doesnt need powerful machines to process all the files in all the branches.
4. Each commit is identified with an SHA1 (Secure Hashing Algorithm 1) hash. Hence its individually indentifiable. 

--Some commands

nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Documents$ git config --global core.edit vim
nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Documents$ git config --global merge.tool vimdiff
nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Documents$ git config --list
user.name=Nasir Munshi
user.email=munshinasir@gmail.com
branch.autosetuprebase=always
color.ui=true
color.status=auto
color.branch=auto
core.edit=vim
merge.tool=vimdiff

As you can see the git config command takes alot of arguments and is used to setup the config of git as per your requirements. The --global argument makes sure that the setting is applied to all repositories on the system.


-- GIT LIFE CYCLE ----

Repo -> Clone - Working Copy -> Add/Modify/Delete - Working Copy -> Diff to review Changes -> Commit/Push - changes -> Amend ( Fix Mistakes ) (optional) -> Push - to the Repo -> (cycle repeats)

--Commands for the steps:

1. Create a User
##TODO

2. Generate a Bare Repo
> pwd
/home/nasir

> mkdir Git/project.git #bare repos should be named .git
> cd Git/project.git
> git --bare init 
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/nasir/Git/project.git/

> ls
branches  config  description  HEAD  hooks  info  objects  refs

3. Creating you SHA keys - 1 public 1 private
 ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/nasir/.ssh/id_rsa): <Enter>
Created directory '/home/nasir/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): <Enter> 
Enter same passphrase again: <Enter>
Your identification has been saved in /home/nasir/.ssh/id_rsa. <Private-key>
Your public key has been saved in /home/nasir/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. <Public-key>
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:GCmuFifGBCUckOaNNiXuN6R4YKqG4gYDVMpSVRMBjbo nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|*+=oo==o         |
|oO... .o         |
|*o*.. o          |
|+X.+ . o         |
|B.O.o . S        |

|++               |
|=.               |
+----[SHA256]-----+

4. Add a file to the staging : ( Here I have create  a README file in repo nm_repo1 )
nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Git/nm_repo1$ git status -s
?? README
nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Git/nm_repo1$ git add .
nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Git/nm_repo1$ git status -s
A  README

5. Committing the changes to the local repo
nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Git/nm_repo1$ git commit -m "Initial Commit"
[master (root-commit) 2472124] Initial Commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README

6. Checking if the commit is logged 
nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Git/nm_repo1$ git log
commit 247212433778ab50fca881d3282c20c9753fc21a (HEAD -> master)

Author: Nasir Munshi <munshinasir@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Jun 26 00:05:58 2018 -0500

    Initial Commit

7. Adding a remote repo for the local repo we just created.

Before we can push the changes further to the remote repo. We need to make the nm_repo1 as the remote of the project.git repo that we created as a bare repo. This is a one time operation and we can then continue adding the files and pushing them to the central repo. 

Git only pushes to the matching branches. So for every branch in the local repo there is a matching branch on the remote side as well.


nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Git/nm_repo1$ git remote add origin ~/Git/project.git
#We didnt login to the server since its a local repo. For online repo you need to start with user@server:repo.git

#Display all the actions that have been performed on the remote
nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Git/nm_repo1$ git remote -v
origin	/home/nasir/Git/project.git (fetch)
origin	/home/nasir/Git/project.git (push)

8. Pushing the changes made to local nm_repo1 to master
nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Git/nm_repo1$ git push origin master
Counting objects: 3, done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 247 bytes | 247.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To /home/nasir/Git/project.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master

These changes are now successfully committed to the remote repo.

9. Cloning the repo from the remote to another dir/system
nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Git$ mkdir nm_repo2
nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Git$ cd nm_repo2
nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Git/nm_repo2$ git clone ~/Git/project.git
Cloning into 'project'...
done.
nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Git/nm_repo2$ ls
project
nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Git/nm_repo2$ cd project/
nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Git/nm_repo2/project$ ls
README

10. Trying the above steps on this file and other notes that I will write in the course of this and other projects. Ill add all of that to my github or gitlab accounts.

Other steps were the same. Create a dir. git-init. move the files. Git add. Git commit. Now its when adding these new files to the repo on github is what started creating a problem. I had to login to github and manually create a repo. Now then I needed to add a remote for this local dir there. 

nasir@Illuminus-Ubuntu2:~/Documents/Git$ git remote add origin https://github.com/munshinasir/gitbasics.git

Now when I was ready to push my commit to the remote repo. I got a fatal error 
fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
Error redoing merge 1234deadbeef1234deadbeef

In order to settle this I used 
>  git pull origin master -allow-unrelated-histories

Reason being I had created the repo with a blank README.md in github. This command allowed for the merge of the docs in both repos. Now I could easily go ahead and do git push origin master

Some syntax 

git  ------ push ------- origin ------------------- master

(vcs)       (cmd)        (local branch)           (remote branch)

11. Before Committing the changes you can do the following

> git log --> displays SHA1 hash value for the commits that you've made on the file. 

Also displays when you pushed the changes to the master (on the remote) as opposed to your head (your latest commit)

> git show <SHA1-val> --> shall display the changes that you made. 

12. Now we need to talk about git diff. Once you make the changes to the file you can choose to see the diff with the committed version

> git diff 

PS : I am going to test this command exactly now...

06-26-2018
Git diff prints the diff from the file with the committed file. 

13. Once the changes have been pushed to the central repo anyone can pull in the changes. 

> git push origin master <-- pushes the committed changes to the master branch. 

> git pull origin master <-- pulls in the changes from the central repo to the origin branch.

14. Now when you are making simultaneous changes to the files in 2 different repos - there are bound to be conflicts. Git doesnt show the conflicts till the changes you committed are supposed to be push to the central repo. 

The funny thing to note here is that git also prints the commit message from when you committed the changes that created the conflict. So you have the commit with the conflicts and then the commit with the conflicts resolved. 

This necessitates the need to pull the repos that you work with every day or atleast before every single commit. Which is a good thing. 

This also leaves a small space where if the central repo is compromised just after someone's push and before there was a pull which copies the changes to any local repo. 

We can now see the error messages that we printed by Git in the 'conflict-file' in the same repo. The file also contains some of the notes I made for triggering the conflict as well

15. Stash : Operation

Stash saves your current stage/workspace and stores it on a stack. This reverts your repo to the last pulled/pushed state. So all your unworked changes are safe while you work on something that is more important. These changes can be committed/pushed/pulled and modified as normal changes without affecting the saved feature work.

Now I tried something funny. I pulled the latest version of the repo with git-pull and then edited a file that was stashed. Now when I issued the "git stash pop" which should ideally have merged my saved work with the current file Git refused to merge. It asked me to commit those edited changes first. The log you can find in the new-feature file in the same repo.

And since I had to overwrite the stashed lines to fix customer code. It also generated an error message. This error message and its resulting logs are also added to the new-feature file.
